~~This `new` branch will be the continuation of the project for a while. I will merge this into the `master` branch when this one advances a lot.~~

I have to say, having such a branch isn't really ideal and it would have been more logical to swap out these 2 branches.

either way, as I've stated in the "EEOn-ABANDONED-" repos, I lost interest in this and I am not coming back.

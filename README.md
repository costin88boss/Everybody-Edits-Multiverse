# EverybodyEditsMultiverse

I abandoned this project too. the older Everybody Edits project (server & client) called EEOn were abandoned because I had to completely remake the entire movement system and implement tick-based logic, as I just realised EE is tick-based, not delta time based (which could even impact server-client relationship), which intrigued me into completely rewriting the codebase.
(additionally, since they were 2 different IDE projects, it was hard and tedious to copy paste so much client-server shared code)

There is a separate branch on this repo called 'new', which is a... third codebase rewrite.

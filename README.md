# EverybodyEditsMultiverse

I abandoned this project too. the older Everybody Edits project (server & client) called EEOn were abandoned because I had to completely remake the entire movement system and implement tick-based logic, as I just realised EE is tick-based, not delta time based (which could even impact server-client relationship).
(additionally, since they were 2 different IDE projects, it was hard and tedious to copy paste so much code)

The reason I abandoned this one is because the code was obviously messy, and I had to remake the networking system, because I used Java's sockets, but I wanted to change to kryonetty (kryo serializer + netty.io networking)

I 100% plan to make an EE remake and properly make it, however (as of 4/27/2023) I am going my path to C++, hence if I do a remake, I'll do it in C++. However, since I am a beginner at C++, I can't just jump straight into making an EE remake.
